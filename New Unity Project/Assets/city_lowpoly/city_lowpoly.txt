- Some buildings are atlased, others are tiled.
- All prefabs have very low resolution realtime lightmap set up by default. (lightmap tab, object menu, Advanced Parameters selector)

Update

- The version 3.0 has a rework in some textures and many new textures (metalicness, roughness and emission)
- Removed the non closed meshes, and all materials reworked with new maps when needed.

Demo scenes sidenote
